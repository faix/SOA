For this laboratory the launchClient.c file has been modified to help 
organize the output of the executions a little bit.
For each version the serverSocket.c file has been modified to obtain
the version expected by the exercise.
An additional file called iterate.sh has been created that helps execute 
launchClient with different values as well as collect the data of these 
executions into the results.csv file.  
In each folder you will find both results.csv and results.ods. The difference
between one and the other is that results.ods contains the graphs.
In the same directory as this README you will also find the file conclusions.txt
