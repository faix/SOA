Workload 1 --> CPU Burst

All of the processes have pretty much the same result when using a round robin policy for scheduling.

In the case of the FCFS scheduling we notice that the parent has less ticks than its children which both children have the same number of ticks.

In conclusion, we think that FCFS has a better policy for this type of workload as the processes spend less time in the ready state.


Workload 2 --> IO Burst

With both scheduling policies, the processes spend the same amount of ticks executing. However, with the round robin scheduling policy the time is spent with the system,
while in the FCFS scheduling policy the time is spent in blocked.

As it could be expected, when the processes are not in execution the idle process is the one that ends up being in execution. 
As such we see that the idle process in the case slightly bigger than the biggest process.


Workload 3 --> Mixed

In RR all proces spend the same time in ready and user, the only thing that varies is the amount of time spent in system.

In FCFS spend the same time in user and change the time spent in system and blocked.

In both cases idle occupies  the cpu when the other processes are blocked.
